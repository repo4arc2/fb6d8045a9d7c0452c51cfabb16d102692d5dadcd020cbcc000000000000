About your son.

but he's still Black.

I saw what you did out there.

And it seems, so did everyone else.

I heard the GRC was standing down
on those plans of theirs,

499
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,875
so you must have done somethin' right.

I ain't gonna lie.

501

You're special.

502

Thank you.

Martin, Mandela, but...

I'm not gonna let
anybody tell me I can't fight for it.

SENATOR: On behalf of
the United States Intelligence Community,

534
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:54,167
I'd like to offer you
and your family our sincerest apologies.

00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:59,000
The Carter name has always been
synonymous with service and trust.

Today, we begin to set things right.

We begin to repay
some of the debt that is owed to you.

Thank you, Senator.

I've been waiting
to hear those words for a long time.

And we'd like to offer you a full pardon.

There may be
an opening in your old division.
